  //
  // Scope worth remembering: axe checks contrast, accessible names, and ARIA
  // wiring on a component in isolation. It cannot see anything that only exists
  // in a real page - focus order across a route, or the 40px tap target floor
  // in docs/design/design-system.md, which is stricter than the 24px axe tests
  // and depends on layout a story does not reproduce. That rule is covered by
  // e2e/tap-targets.e2e.ts instead.
