/**
 * `getPosts`/`getPost` degrade to `POST_FALLBACK` when the live fetch
 * throws (a GitHub outage, or - post I3 - the listing call itself failing).
 * Nothing previously exercised that path: an absence assertion ("the posts
 * page doesn't crash") would pass whether or not the fallback actually
 * fires. `fetchPosts` calls the real `fetch` global and Playwright can't
 * intercept it (this runs server-side), so the only way to force the
 * failure is to mock `@patorsiang/content` itself.
 *
 * `mock.module` swaps the module for every import that happens after this
 * call, including the dynamic `import("./posts")` below - which is why
 * `getPosts`/`getPost` are imported dynamically inside each test rather
 * than statically at the top of the file. The static import of
 * `POST_FALLBACK` above runs first (module evaluation, before any test
 * body), so it captures the real fallback data to assert against.
