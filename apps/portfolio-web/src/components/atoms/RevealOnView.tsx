 * Reveals its children once, the first time they scroll into view - or
 * leaves them alone if they're already in view when this mounts, or if
 * prefers-reduced-motion is set (motion-guidelines.md: "Disable section
 * reveals," not "make them instant").
 *
 * Defaults to visible: the hidden state only exists once this effect has
 * run and found the element off-screen, never in the server-rendered
 * HTML, so content never depends on JavaScript to become visible - only
 * to animate. IntersectionObserver always delivers its initial
 * observation asynchronously, so a below-the-fold section is briefly
 * painted visible before this effect can hide it, regardless of which
 * effect hook sets the observer up - that transition-out is never meant
 * to be seen, though, so it has no transition at all (see the
 * `transition-none` on the hidden branch below): a hard cut, not a
 * fade, so nothing visibly flashes.
