/**
 * A sitemap is a set of promises to a crawler, and nothing in the build checks
 * that the app keeps them. These tests do.
 *
 * The one that matters is that every listed URL answers 200. Listing a URL that
 * redirects is the easy mistake here, because `/cv` and `/cv/[role]` are real,
 * linked, working routes - they just are not canonical. Pointing a crawler at
 * them spends its budget rediscovering `/[lang]/cv/[role]`, and splits the
 * signal between two URLs for one page.
 *
 * Requests go to the local server, so only each entry's pathname is used - the
 * origin in the file comes from NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL and is whatever the deploy
 * target is.
