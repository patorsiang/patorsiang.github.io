  subtitle: `I'm “Pat” Napatchol Thaipanich, a software developer and MSc Advanced Computer Science student at the University of Kent (graduating 2025). With over three years of experience as a Frontend Developer at Data Wow Co., Ltd. and the Bank of Thailand, I’ve worked on fintech systems, PDPA compliance platforms, and dashboards that support both internal and client-facing applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My technical toolkit includes React, Next.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python (FastAPI, TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). I also bring hands-on project experience in machine learning (image classification, blockchain fraud detection), IoT prototyping, and cryptography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alongside my technical background, I hold a Bachelor of Science in ICT (Mahidol University) and a Bachelor of Laws (Ramkhamhaeng University), giving me a unique multidisciplinary perspective that bridges technology, security, and legal considerations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm deeply passionate about technology and data. My motto, passed down from my grandfather, is “If anyone can do it, I can do it.” I apply this mindset daily in my coding practice, CTF challenges, and continuous learning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I look ahead, I'm open to opportunities in software development, machine learning, or cybersecurity across Thailand, the UK, the EU, Singapore, and Australia. <b>Let's build something remarkable together!</b>
